= Spring AMPQ

Spring AMQP is an alternative approach to distributing events, besides Axon Server which is the default.

Axon provides out-of-the-box support to transfer events to and from an AMQP message broker, such as link:https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ,window=_blank,role=external].

To use the Spring AMQP components from Axon, make sure the `axon-amqp` module is available on the classpath.

Once added to the classpath of your application, you can use the Spring AMQP extension to:
