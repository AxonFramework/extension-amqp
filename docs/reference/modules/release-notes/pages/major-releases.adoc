[#_release_4_5]
== Release 4.5

* Issue [#5](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-amqp/pull/5) introduces Dependabot.
This updated a large amount of the versions used by this extension.

* We updated all tests to a more current testing solution.
This means we introduced [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and updated JUnit to version 5.
You can find the made changes in [this](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-amqp/pull/44) pull request.

[#_release_4_3]
== Release 4.3

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.3.

[#_release_4_2]
== Release 4.2

We did not introduce any significant changes other than updating the extension to use Axon Framework release 4.2.

[#_release_4_1]
== Release 4.1

A version predicament caused the extension to load the wrong package for the `ChannelAwareMessageListener`.
We resolved this issue for release 4.1 [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-amqp/issues/1).

Furthermore, we updated the dependency on Axon Framework to 4.1.

[#_release_4_0]
== Release 4.0

We split off the AMQP logic from Axon Framework core into a dedicated repository.
Next to that, it complies with Axon Framework's 4.0 release.
